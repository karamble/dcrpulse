# Decred Dashboard Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# Volume Configuration
# For app store integration (Umbrel, Start9, CasaOS), this can be overridden
# Standalone: uses Docker named volume (default: dcrpulse_app-data)
# Umbrel: set to managed path like /umbrel/app-data/<app-id>
# Leave empty or set to "app-data" for default behavior
#APP_DATA_DIR=app-data

# Decred RPC Credentials
# These are used by both dcrd and the backend
DCRD_RPC_USER=decred
DCRD_RPC_PASS=change_this_to_a_secure_password

# Dcrwallet RPC Credentials
# Used by dcrwallet and the backend to access wallet
DCRWALLET_RPC_USER=dcrwallet
DCRWALLET_RPC_PASS=change_this_to_a_secure_wallet_password

# Docker Image Tags (optional)
# Set these to use pre-built images instead of building locally
# Significantly speeds up deployment and ensures consistent builds
# Images are published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# Leave commented to build from source (default behavior)
#DCRD_IMAGE_TAG=latest
#DCRWALLET_IMAGE_TAG=latest
#DASHBOARD_IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Build Configuration
# Only used if building from source (no image tags set above)
# Optional: dcrd version/branch to build (default: release-v2.0.6)
# Can be a tag (e.g., release-v2.0.6) or branch name
#DCRD_VERSION=release-v2.0.6

# Optional: dcrwallet version/branch to build (default: release-v2.0.6)
# Can be a tag (e.g., release-v4.0.0) or branch name
#DCRWALLET_VERSION=release-v2.0.6

# dcrd Extra Arguments
# Enable transaction index for block explorer functionality
# This allows full transaction lookup by hash
# Note: First startup with this flag will trigger a full blockchain reindex (may take hours)
DCRD_EXTRA_ARGS=--txindex

# Dcrwallet Address Gap Limit (default: 400)
# This controls how many consecutive unused addresses the wallet will monitor
# Increase this if you have funds at higher address indices that aren't being discovered
# Common values: 100 (fast), 400 (recommended), 1000 (thorough), 5000 (very thorough)
# Higher values increase memory usage and rescan time
DCRWALLET_GAP_LIMIT=100

# Optional: Uncomment for testnet
# DCRD_TESTNET=1
